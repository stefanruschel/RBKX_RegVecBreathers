# RBKX_RegVecBreathers

Source code made by Stefan Ruschel to generate the data and figures for the paper:

	Regenerative vectorial breathers in a delay-coupled neuromorphic microlaser with integrated saturable absorber (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20177)
	by Stefan Ruschel, Venkata A. Pammi, Rémy Braive, Isabelle Sagnes, Grégoire Beaudoin, Neil G. R. Broderick, Bernd Krauskopf, Sylvain Barbay
 
The source code is made in Matlab2022, and uses the latest version of the software package "DDE-Biftools" (https://github.com/DDE-BifTool/DDE-Biftool).

The source code is contained in the folder RG_MasterEquation, and the two main scripts to be executed are the following: 

	- mainGenData.m: this script generates the data for the manuscript. It will generate the necessary ".mat" files to be used for ploting the figures. The ".mat" files will be stored in the Data folder.
	- mainFigGen.m: this script generates the ".eps" and ".png" figures for the paper using the ".mat" files generated by "mainGenData.m". 

Currently, all the data must be computed once due to the size constraints of GitHub.

Please change the scripts to load the correct address where your installation of DDE-Biftool is saved.
